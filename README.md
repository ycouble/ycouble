## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - 🚵‍♀️🧗 [velogrimpe.fr](https://velogrimpe.fr) to bring Florent's ideas to the web.
  - ⛰️🚶 [les repérage d'albert](https://les-reperages-d-albert.vercel.app) to contemplate 30 years of walking.
  - ⛷️🎿 [les plagnes](https://les-plagnes.vercel.app) to help people find and reach their ESF meeting point.
  - ✈️❌ [changer d'approche](https://couble.eu/site/treks) to recall and show how travelling is not about the destination.
- 🌐 [couble.eu](https://couble.eu)
